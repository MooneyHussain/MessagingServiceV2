# Messaging Service 

A simple console application which uses a [hosted service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-2.2) to consumer messages from an azure [service bus namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/)

## Prerequisites

Unfortunately MS do not provide a 'Service Bus Emulator', so to test this application you are required to have an azure service bus namespace. You can create one by signing up to a free [azure trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/service-bus/).

## Running the tests

## Deployment

## Built With

.NET Core 2.2
